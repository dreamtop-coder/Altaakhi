Summary

Remove legacy migration files that were superseded by squashed migrations for services, cars, and inventory.
These squashes were created to simplify fresh installs; follow-up migrations were added where cross-app fields were required.

Why this PR

Keeps new installs fast/clean by using squashed migrations.
Old migrations are kept only for backward compatibility; now we remove them after verification.

What I changed

Deleted legacy migration files (see branch chore/remove-old-squashed-migrations).
Squashed migrations are already present and committed: services/migrations/0001_squashed_0003_add_car_fk.py, services/migrations/0002_add_parts_and_car.py, cars/migrations/0001_squashed_0004_maintenancerecord_maintenance_date.py, inventory/migrations/0001_squashed_0007_part_track_purchases_part_track_sales.py.
Minor model fix: inventory.models.Part.department uses a lazy FK to avoid import-time issues.

Checklist — REQUIRED before merging

- [ ] Confirm `manage.py showmigrations` on local/staging/production shows the squashed migrations recorded.
- [ ] Run `manage.py migrate --plan` in each environment and confirm no unexpected operations.
- [ ] Confirm ops/staging have applied the squashed migrations (or run `manage.py migrate` there).
- [ ] CI green (mapping command dry-run already runs in CI).

Verification commands (run in each environment)

powershell
```
$env:DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='devkey'; venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py showmigrations
```

Migration plan:

powershell
```
$env:DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='devkey'; venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate --plan
